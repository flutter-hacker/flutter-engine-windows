# This is a basic workflow to help you get started with Actions

name: Flutter Windows Host Engine

# Controls when the workflow will run
on:
  schedule:
    # * is a special character in YAML so you have to quote this string
    - cron:  '0 14 * * *' # 22:00
    - cron:  '0 0 * * *'  # 0:00
    - cron:  '15 3 * * *' # 11:15
    - cron:  '20 6 * * *' # 14:20
  # Triggers the workflow on push or pull request events but only for the main branch
  # push:
  #   branches: [ main ]
  # pull_request:
  #   branches: [ main ]
